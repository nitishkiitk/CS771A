All the code has been written on python3

Libraries need to run the code:
Numpy
Scikit-Learn

For Method-1 the file name is convex.py
For Mwthod-2 the file name is regress.py

Before running the code check the path of npy files at top of code in each files

After running the code it will print following things:
1. the shape of all the npy and means shapes
2. in convex.py only accuracy and in regress.py it will print accuracy for every lambda and also max accuracy and it's corresponding lambda
